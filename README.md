What role does a single decision tree play inside a random forest? Does it matter on its own, or only as part of the collective?
In this article, we'll cover:
Decision trees, in plain words: how splits work (Gini/Entropy), why they overfit, and a quick baseline on our dataset.
Taming a tree: pruning (cost-complexity) and growth limits (max_depth, min_samples_*) with before/after results.
Random Forest = bagging + random features: why averaging many decorrelated trees helps - the forest swallows the noise of a single overfitted tree - plus OOB as a built-in check.
From forest to insight: SHAP summary/beeswarm to see which features matter and in what direction.
Practical takeaways: when to prefer a single interpretable tree, when to deploy a forest, and how to report metrics cleanly.

Important disclaimer: The data set used in this article  is a synthetic data set, created for model explanation only. The trees are imaginary, the rainfall obeys a random number generator, and the sunlight was rounded for your convenience. Do not use this as botany or forestry guidance - no planting, pruning, logging, or squirrel-rehoming decisions should be based on it. For real-world advice, consult a forester, not a Random Forest.
No trees were harmed in this analysis - some were merely overfitted.

Why This Dataset?
This synthetic dataset was created as a playful way to demonstrate the difference between a single Decision Tree and a Random Forest.
Each row is a tree in a forest, described by ecological traits like height, leaf size, soil quality, rainfall, and sunlight.
Trees & Forests Dataset:  Data Dictionary
Tree_Height_m: Height of the tree in meters.
Leaf_Size :  Categorical size of leaves: small, medium, or large.
Soil_Quality: Soil fertility on a 1–10 scale (higher = richer).
Rainfall_mm: Annual rainfall in millimeters for the tree's environment.
Sunlight_Hours :  Average daily sunlight hours.
Has_Fruit:  1 if the tree produces fruit, 0 otherwise.
Is_Conifer :  1 if the tree is a conifer, 0 otherwise.
Forest_Density:  Number of trees per hectare in the surrounding forest.
Tree_Age : Age of the tree in years.
Survival_in_Forest: Target variable (1 = survives/thrives, 0 = does not).
